_This is part of a series of posts that summarize my meetings with Professor Ian M. Mitchell for our own records._

During the seventh meeting, on March 27th, we will discuss the following.

## This week's highlights
TBD
- Read the following:
  - [Static / time-independent HJ PDE Fast Marching Method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2013.2248309)
  - [Ken Alton's thesis (first two chapters)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10915-011-9512-4)
  - [Chapter 2.7 of the Toolbox of Level Set Method manual](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/ToolboxLS/ClickCounter/click.php?id=6)

## Items for discussion
- Tasks from last week.
- Strategies for safely performing direct hops to far nodes.
  - This shouldn't be a problem if the graph has a higher resolution than the risk data.
    - However, it's not obvious that there wouldn't be an edge case where this is suboptimal.

## Goals for next meeting
TBD
- Work on generating a performant multi-resolution bathymetry library.
  - Use API calls to generate a QuadTree-based format for offline use by all of the micro/local and global planners.
  - For a given scenario space, the source QuadTree-based format is used to create a look up map between the values and locations we care about (e.g. graph nodes).
