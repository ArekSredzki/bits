_This is part of a series of posts that summarize my meetings with Professor Ian M. Mitchell for our own records._

During the second meeting, on January 26th, we reviewed the previous week's analysis of the state of the target problem and better defined the short-term plan for the course.

Further investigation of recent publications relating to autonomous sailboats show that there is a lot of room for improvement not only in regards to obstacle avoidance but also controller design. As part of my work for UBC Sailbot, I developed control algorithms that overcome the weaknesses put forward by presently published papers. The first step is to evaluate my controller vs others in a well-defined set of scenarios.

Before being able to evaluate the aforementioned controllers, I need to strengthen my formal knowledge of control system design and analysis. This will also require the study of Ordinary Differential Equations.

## Goals for the upcoming week
- Define scenarios in which controllers will be evaluated
- Describe problem state space
- Study Ordinary Differential Equations
- Evaluate existing controllers in MATLAB
  - _Note: ODE45 might be a good fit_
- Continue developing models for vehicle dynamics
- Continue work on a reading list
