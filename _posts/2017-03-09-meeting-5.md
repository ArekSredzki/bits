_This is part of a series of posts that summarize my meetings with Professor Ian M. Mitchell for our own records._

During the fifth meeting, on March 9th, we discussed the following.

## This week's highlights
- Refined drafts of the following based on previous discussions:
  - [State space & boat model]({% post_url 2017-02-10-state-space %})
  - [Evaluation scenario]({% post_url 2017-02-11-evaluation-scenario %})
- Composed the following drafts:
  - [Planning architecture overview]({% post_url 2017-03-05-planning-architecture %})
  - [Perception]({% post_url 2017-03-09-perception %}) (early draft)
- Made progress towards using K. Wille's Masters thesis materials as a platform for controller & micro/local planner evaluation.
  - Extending it to support the [evaluation scenario]({% post_url 2017-02-11-evaluation-scenario %}).
  - Work on an initial, naive micro planner implementation.
- Extensive progress in developing a planet-level planner.
  - Pathfinding between any two points on the planet works and is highly performant.
  - Highly extensible, modular design created with testability in mind.
  - Added a CLI.
    - Has a .kml output option for easy display on Google Maps.
  - Project will also be used for the production-intent realtime planner.
    - There are many general-purpose utilities required, maintaining a common library with a mono-repo helps ensure that nothing diverges.
    - This will make E2E testing easier and maintaining cross-system compatibility easy.
      - Unit tests that use both libraries can be easily implemented.
      - A target containing all planners would simple to make.
    - The global planner can be used to bootstrap micro/local.
      - The current A* implementation will be useful for local.
- Further readings from Siegwart's Intro to Autonomous Mobile Robots, specifically relating to sensors.

## Summary of discussion
- Reviewed the above.
- Decided to shift focus to developing a Global solution first in order to ensure that one of the system components is completed as a deliverable by the end of the term.
  - Postpone further development of the micro/local planner (on vessel).
- Discussed:
  - Ada 1.0's global path planner
  - The global planning problem
  - The current geodesic grid approach to global
  - Alternative methods (e.g. Fast marching, Fast sweeping)

## Goals for next meeting
- Define the global pathfinding problem (mathematically).
- Read the following:
  - [Ian's IROS 2008 Workshop Slides](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/Talks/mitchellIROS.pdf)
  - [Static / time-independent HJ PDE Fast Marching Method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2013.2248309)
  - [Ken Alton's thesis (first two chapters)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10915-011-9512-4)
  - [Chapter 2.7 of the Toolbox of Level Set Method manual](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/ToolboxLS/ClickCounter/click.php?id=6)
- Further development of the global (planet-level) planner (on server).
  - Augment the geodesic graph by making distant neighbours available (neighbour reach $$n$$). This will double (or better with $$n > 2$$) the angular resolution available to the vessel at any time, offering the following benefits:
    - Significantly reduce the tendency for the path to travel along the geodesic grid's original geometry.
    - Increase the accuracy/benefit of modeling vessel performance against apparent wind.
    - Note: watch for problems with hitting obstacles by "hopping" over them.
  - Display generated paths on the Viewer (OpenGL GUI application).
    - Use an additional GL_ARRAY_BUFFER containing a mapping of colour to each edge.
