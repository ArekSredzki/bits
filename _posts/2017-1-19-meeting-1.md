_This is part of a series of posts that summarize my meetings with Professor Ian M. Mitchell for our own records._

During the first meeting, on January 19th, we took a high-level view of the goals for this directed studies course, discussed the target problem, and established short-term deliverables.

Originally the proposed focus of my directed studies was to develop and present a method for extending Informed RRT* (Gammell et al. 2014) to support non-linear motion planning. The proposed method would be evaluated in the application of optimal real-time motion planning for an autonomous sailboat. The main deliverable of this effort was to be a standard IEEE style conference paper that would be submitted to IROS 2017 by the March 1st draft deadline.

However, after serious initial investigation, I concluded that improving convergence rates on an optimal solution by applying Informed RRT* would not benefit the primary challenges of kinodynamic planning for an autonomous sailboat. Most notably, these are:
- The mode-like performance characteristics of a sailing vessel in general
- The necessity for fast discovery of an initial solution

The latter point here is why I have decided that Informed RRT* is not the best candidate for initial exploration of this problem. Additionally, the target problem has unique characteristics not seen in other, more commonly considered, nonholonomic robots, such as autonomous cars; the specifics of which will be discussed in the next post. Ultimately we agreed that the best path to take is to focus on the problem of real-time motion planning for an autonomous sailboat. First I will explicitly define the problem space and kinodynamic constraints of the vessel. After which I will apply and evaluate existing non-linear motion planning techniques. Finally, I will present an architecture for the onboard planning/control system(s) and potentially offer an improved problem-specific planner.

Another deliverable that was proposed and agreed upon is a reading log of relevant academic papers that I have studied. In order to keep track of the key points/findings of each paper, I will add a couple sentences below each citation. This will be available as a blog post soon.
